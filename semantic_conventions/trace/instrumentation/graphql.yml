        type: string
        examples: 'findBookById'
      - id: graphql.operation.type
        brief: "The name of the operation being executed."
        type: string
        examples: ['QUERY', 'MUTATION', 'SUBSCRIPTION']
      - id: graphql.source
        brief: "The GraphQL query being executed."
        type: string
        note: The value may be sanitized to exclude sensitive information.

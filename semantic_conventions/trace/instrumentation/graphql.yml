      operations to attributes on a Span.
    attributes:
      - id: operation.name
        brief: "The name of the operation being executed."
        type: string
        examples: 'findBookById'
      - id: operation.type
        brief: "The type of the operation being executed."
        type: string
        examples: ['QUERY', 'MUTATION', 'SUBSCRIPTION']
      - id: operation.body
        brief: "The GraphQL query being executed."
        type: string
        note: The value may be sanitized to exclude sensitive information.
        examples: 'query findBookById { bookById(id: ?) { name } }'
